Repository Structures
---------------------

There will be several (still proposal) branches: 

* **master**
* **development**
* **client** (GWT)
* **backend** (PHP)

* **bleeding-edge**
* **nodejs-backend** (optional)
* **backbone-client** (optional)

**client** and **backend** will merge into **development** while **development**
will merge into **master** during release

**nodejs-backend** and **backbone-client** will merge into **bleeding-edge**.
It just for fun and practice. However if proved to be useful will be
merge into **development** and perhaps, **master**
